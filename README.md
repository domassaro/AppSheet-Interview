## Goal
The goal is to make a React app that fetches and displays these user profiles. You can use any modules / frameworks / state management approach you like. The UI design is up to you, but it should be appropriate for the data and have a reasonably modern / professional look. At a minimum it should include the following details:

  ✔️ A search input that filters the view to only show profiles matching the search
  ✔️ The search option should be hidden or disabled until all API calls are done
  ✔️ Profiles without valid U.S. phone numbers should not be displayed

Here are some things we focus on when reviewing the project:

- Code readability and cleanness of design and implementation
- Correct and efficient handling of the async API calls
- Page load behavior while data fetching is in progress
- Your approach to managing user input and application state
- UI that suggests good design sense
- Any discussion you’d like to include about your thought process

## Deliverables
Thank you for this challenge, I loved working on it!
